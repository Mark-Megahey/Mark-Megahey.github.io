            <h4>Indee</h4>
            <h4>Apprentice Developer</h4>
            <br>
            <p>
              During this period, I was working with Indee on a freelance basis,
              this was very much a training role and I was given guidance and resources
              to develop my skills in web and web application development.
              I had to use these new skills to solve problems for Indee’s clients,
              this included tasks ranging from creating simple web pages to much more
              complex interfaces for custom applications.
              It was in this role that I gained most of my foundation in programming
              knowledge and acquired core skill sets; including teamwork, time management
              and a deeper understanding / experience of Customer Service.
              I also was able to greatly improve my literacy skills, this had a direct
              benefit to the quality of communication I was having with both the team and the clients.
              During my time at this level, I mostly worked under the supervision of the
              company director in the company’s office.

            <h4>Indee</h4>
            <h4>Junior Developer</h4>
            <br>
            <p>
              As the company began to grow, I was offered a full time position as a junior developer.
              My responsibilities increased and I was required to direct my own learning and produce
              independent work for Indee’s clients without the same level of direct guidance.
              One of the biggest challenges I had to face was the transition from a centralized team
              to a decentralised remote one. This came with it many new problems and many new practises
              that I had to learn.
              On several occasions I was given the opportunity to lead a project and as a result of that
              was presented, on a few occasions, with needing to meet the clients face-to-face independently.
              This taught me a lot of valuable communication skills, including how to organise and run a meeting,
              how to manage expense claims through an accounting system, how to negotiate on expectations and
              how to feedback to management.
